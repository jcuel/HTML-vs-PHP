# What is a Container?

A container is a standard unit of software that contains everything needed to run the application - code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings. This makes the application self-contained and portable across different environments and cloud providers.

## Benefits of Using Containers

- **Lightweight**: Containers share the host operating system, making them much more lightweight than traditional virtual machines. This allows you to run more containers on a single host, leading to higher resource utilization and potentially cost savings.

- **Consistent Runs**: Containers ensure that the application runs consistently in any environment, whether it's on a developer's laptop, in a test environment, or in production. This eliminates issues caused by differences in operating systems, libraries, or configuration settings.

- **Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Containers make it easier to implement CI/CD pipelines, as each build of the application can be tested and deployed within a container. This helps to ensure that the application is always in a releasable state.

- **Resource Isolation**: Containers provide a way to isolate resources, so that one application's performance doesn't impact another application running on the same machine. This helps to improve the overall stability and reliability of the system.

- **Security**: Containers help to enhance security by providing a clear boundary between the application and the host system. This makes it easier to manage and limit the potential damage caused by security vulnerabilities or breaches.

# What is Docker?

Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers. It enables rapid development, testing, and deployment of applications while providing increased portability, security, and scalability. Docker's underlying technology is containerization, which allows developers to bundle up an application with all of its dependencies into a single unit, called a container.

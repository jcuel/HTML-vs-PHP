# What is Docker?

Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers. It enables rapid development, testing, and deployment of applications while providing increased portability, security, and scalability. Docker's underlying technology is containerization, which allows developers to bundle up an application with all of its dependencies into a single unit, called a container.
